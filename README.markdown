One of my first Django/Python projects.  Was a simple app that would allow a busines to pre-register their clients and allow them to upload images of their product to share with others. Very little comments/docs and some of the var names are pretty awful.

I was proud of the single sign on idea in which the client never used a password.  They were emailed a link that would allow them to edit their profile.  Once they had used the link it was dead and they would have to request another if they wanted to modify again.

Other than that, pretty normal stuff.  Upload images, resize them in ratio, store them, regurgitate when needed.

No license.  Use as you wish.
